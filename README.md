# ScrapBros

## About

My name is Jake Marquardt, and ScrapBros is a project that I worked on with two classmates in my senior year at the University of Washington. It's a side-scrolling shooter where the user plays as a cyborg. There are enemy robots patrolling the area that you must destroy or avoid in search of the green flag which, upon reaching, results in the user beating the game. I'd love polish this project up some time and add to it, but I'm focused on other projects at the moment.

## Development status:

This game is by no means finished and low on my list of priorities at the moment, but when I do get around to developing the game further, expect these things:

- A menu where the user can at least choose between different levels (There are already multiple levels created and a parser that builds levels based off of .txt files, so this should be fairly easy and I may even add the option for a user to upload their own levels)
- "Smarter" enemies
- More enemies
- More weapons
- Powerups
